---

## Relationships

1. **User & Profile**: One-to-One relationship (A user has one profile)
2. **User & Matchmaking**: Many-to-Many relationship (Users can be matched with multiple other users)
3. **User & Message**: One-to-Many relationship (A user can send many messages)

---

## API Endpoints (Sample)

### User Endpoints

- **POST /users/**: Register a new user
- **GET /users/{id}/**: Retrieve user profile
- **POST /token/**: Obtain a JWT token for authentication

### Matchmaking Endpoints

- **GET /matches/**: Get matches for a user
- **POST /matches/**: Create a new matchmaking entry (match between two users)

### Message Endpoints

- **POST /messages/**: Send a message between users
- **GET /messages/{user_id}/**: Retrieve messages for a user

---

## Authentication

- Use **Token Authentication** for securing endpoints
- **POST /token/**: Endpoint for login, which returns a token for future requests

---

## Future Considerations

1. Add **Search** functionality for matchmaking based on user preferences (e.g., religion, caste, location).
2. Implement **Privacy settings** to allow users to control who can view their profile.
3. **Real-time messaging** using WebSockets for better communication.

---

### Notes

- The `CustomUser` model is based on **AbstractBaseUser** to allow flexibility in authentication and custom fields.
- The `Profile` model stores additional information about the user that is not part of the core authentication fields.
- The `Matchmaking` model tracks user matches based on shared interests, compatibility, and other factors.
- The `Message` model allows for asynchronous communication between users.

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement API views for each of the above models.
2. Test the APIs using **Postman**.
3. Integrate front-end interfaces with the Django back-end.
