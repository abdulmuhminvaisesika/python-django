# Updation on Student Task



## New App Structure and Model Updates

### New App Structure

The project was restructured by creating separate apps for handling specific domains:

1. teacher_app: Manages teacher-related data and functionality.
2. department_app: Manages department data and associations.
3. school_app: Manages school data and relevant details.

These changes allow each app to handle its specific tasks and models, improving code modularity and separation of concerns.

### Model Updates
1. Teacher Model Update
   
    * The Teacher_Task model was removed from student_app and added to teacher_app as Teachers_Task.
    * The performance field was introduced in the Teachers_Task model to track teacher performance based on student marks.
    ``` python
    class Teachers_Task(models.Model):
    employee_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    performance = models.FloatField(default=0.0)
    department_ID = models.ForeignKey('department_app.Department_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
    school_ID = models.ForeignKey('school_app.School_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
    ```

2. Updated Student_Task Model
    * The Student_Task model in student_app was modified to include a foreign key teacher_id pointing to Teachers_Task in teacher_app.
    * A new save() method was implemented to calculate and update the total marks, percentage, and teacher performance whenever student marks change.
    ``` python
    class Student_Task(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    roll_no = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    chemistry = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    physics = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    maths = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    total_marks_field = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    percentage_field = models.FloatField(default=0.0)
    teacher_id = models.ForeignKey('teacher_app.Teachers_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.total_marks_field = calculate_total_marks(self.chemistry, self.physics, self.maths)
        self.percentage_field = calculate_percentage(self.total_marks_field)
        if self.teacher_id:
            students = Student_Task.objects.filter(teacher_id=self.teacher_id_id)
            performance = calculate_performance(students)
            Teachers_Task.objects.filter(employee_id=self.teacher_id_id).update(performance=performance)
        super(Student_Task, self).save(*args, **kwargs)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
    ```
3. Department and School Models

    * Department_Task model, located in department_app, includes fields for department ID, department name, department HOD, and association with School_Task.
    * School_Task model, located in school_app, stores school-specific data.
    ``` python
    # department_app.models
    class Department_Task(models.Model):
    department_ID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    department_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    department_HOD = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    school_ID = models.ForeignKey('school_app.School_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.department_name
    ```
    ---
    ``` python
    # school_app.models
    class School_Task(models.Model):
    school_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    school_ID = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    school_location = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.school_name
        
    ```

### Foreign Key Relationships

- **Department_Task model** (in `department_app`):
  - `school_ID`: Links each department to a school in `school_app`.

  ```python
  school_ID = models.ForeignKey('school_app.School_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
  ```

- **Teachers_Task model** (in `teacher_app`):
  - `department_ID`: Connects each teacher to a department in `department_app`.
  - `school_ID`: Links each teacher to a school in `school_app`.

  ```python
  department_ID = models.ForeignKey('department_app.Department_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
  school_ID = models.ForeignKey('school_app.School_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
  ```

- **Student_Task model** (in `student_app`):
  - `teacher_id`: Links each student to a teacher by referencing `employee_id` in `Teachers_Task`.

  ```python
  teacher_id = models.ForeignKey('teacher_app.Teachers_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
  ```

# Utilities

## utils/utils.py

This module contains utility functions for calculating total marks, percentages, averages, and performance metrics for students.

### Functions

#### `calculate_total_marks(chemistry, physics, maths)`
Calculate the total marks for a student.

**Parameters:**
- `chemistry` (int): Marks obtained in Chemistry.
- `physics` (int): Marks obtained in Physics.
- `maths` (int): Marks obtained in Maths.

**Returns:**
- int: Total marks obtained by the student.
``` python
def calculate_total_marks(chemistry, physics, maths):
    """Calculate the total marks for a student."""
    return chemistry + physics + maths

```
---

#### `calculate_percentage(total_marks)`
Calculate the percentage based on total marks.
