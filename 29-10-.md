## 1. Exception Handling and Status Codes

### Enhanced Error Messaging and Status Code Standardization

Error handling was refined to include specific error messages and standardized status codes for improved API response consistency. These changes provide more detailed feedback for users and developers.

Example modifications:
- **500 Internal Server Error** for unexpected exceptions:
  ```python
  except Exception as e:
      return Response({'error': str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
  ```
- **404 Not Found** if a teacher or other resource does not exist:
  ```python
  except Teachers_Task.DoesNotExist:
      return Response({"message": "Teacher does not exist"}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
  ```
- **400 Bad Request** for validation errors:
  ```python
  return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
  ```
- **200 OK** for successful updates with confirmation messages:
  ```python
  return Response({"message": "Teacher updated successfully", "data": serializer.data}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
  ```
- **404 Not Found** for invalid endpoints:
  ```python
  return Response({"error": "Invalid endpoint"}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
  ```

## 2. Optimizing Code with `.update()` Method

To streamline database operations, `.update()` has been implemented in place of `.save()` where applicable, minimizing the code needed to update records.

### Updating `is_active` Status with `.update()`

The `is_active` status for related records (such as students linked to a teacher) was originally managed using `.save()`, but was refactored to use `.update()` for more concise and efficient code.




The `save()` method in the `Teachers_Task` model was adjusted to leverage `.update()` for updating student statuses based on teacher `is_active` changes.

```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    if self.pk is not None:
        old_instance = Teachers_Task.objects.get(pk=self.pk)
        if old_instance.is_active != self.is_active:
            Student_Task = apps.get_model('student_app', 'Student_Task')
            Student_Task.objects.filter(teacher_id=self).update(is_active=self.is_active)

    super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

Using `.update()` minimizes database calls by allowing bulk updates, improving code efficiency, and maintaining cleaner code.
