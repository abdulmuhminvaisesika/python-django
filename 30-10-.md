# Django Project Update: School, Teacher, Department, and Student



## Models Updates

### 1. School Model (`school_app/models.py`)

- **ManyToManyField for Departments**: Added a `ManyToManyField` from `School_Task` to `Department_Task` to associate multiple departments with each school.

```python
department_ID = models.ManyToManyField('department_app.Department_Task', blank=True)
```

### 2. Teacher Model (`teacher_app/models.py`)

- **ManyToManyField for Departments**: Added a ManyToManyField from Teachers_Task to Department_Task to allow teachers to belong to multiple departments.
python
``` python
department_ID = models.ManyToManyField('department_app.Department_Task', blank=True, related_name='teachers')
```

## API Views Update

### 1. Teacher API (`teacher_app/views.py`)
* **POST Method**: Allows creation of a new teacher with validation for associated school and department.
python
```python
def post(self, request):
    try:
        serializer = TeacherTaskSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
    except Exception as e:
        return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
```
* **PUT Method**: Allows updating an existing teacher based on employee_id.
python
```python
def put(self, request, employee_id=None):
    try:
        teacher = Teachers_Task.objects.get(employee_id=employee_id)
    except Teachers_Task.DoesNotExist:
        return Response({"message": "Teacher does not exist"}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

    serializer = TeacherTaskSerializer(teacher, data=request.data, partial=True)  
    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save()
        return Response({"message": "Teacher updated successfully", "data": serializer.data}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
    
    return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
## 2. School API (`school_app/views.py`)
* **POST Method**: Allows creation of a new school.


```python
def post(self, request):
    try:
        serializer = SchoolTaskSerializer(data=request.data)
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
    except Exception as e:
        return Response({'error': str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
```
* **PUT Method**: Allows updating an existing school based on school_ID.
python
```python
def put(self, request, school_ID=None):
    try:
        school = School_Task.objects.get(school_ID=school_ID)
    except School_Task.DoesNotExist:
        return Response(status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

    serializer = SchoolTaskSerializer(school, data=request.data)
    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save()
        return Response(serializer.data)
    return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

## Serializer Updates


### 1. Teacher Serializer Validation (`teacher_app/serializers.py`)

* **Department Validation**: Ensures that the department being assigned to a teacher belongs to the same school as the teacher.
python
```python
def validate_department_ID(self, value):
    school_id = self.initial_data.get('school_ID')
    if school_id:
        school = get_object_or_404(School_Task, school_ID=school_id)
        valid_departments = set(school.department_ID.values_list('department_ID', flat=True))

        for department in value:
            if department.department_ID not in valid_departments:
                raise serializers.ValidationError(f"Department {department.department_name} is not associated with the selected school.")
    return value
```
### 2. Student Serializer Validation (`student_app/serializers.py`)
* **Teacher and Department Validation**: Ensures that the teacher assigned to a student belongs to the same school and department as the student.

```python
def validate_teacher_id(self, value):
    teacher_id = self.initial_data.get('teacher_id')
    school_id = self.initial_data.get('school_ID')

    if teacher_id:
        teacher = get_object_or_404(Teachers_Task, employee_id=teacher_id)
        if school_id and teacher.school_ID.school_ID != school_id:
            raise serializers.ValidationError(f"Teacher {teacher.employee_id} does not belong to school ID: {school_id}.")

        valid_departments = set(teacher.department_ID.values_list('department_ID', flat=True))
        department_id = self.initial_data.get('department_ID')

        if department_id is not None and department_id not in valid_departments:
            raise serializers.ValidationError(f"Teacher {teacher.employee_id} does not belong to department ID: {department_id}.")
    return value
```


## Scripts

### 1. School App Script (school_app/scripts.py)


* Assign Random Departments to Schools: Assigns random departments to active schools.
python

```python
import random
from school_app.models import School_Task
from department_app.models import Department_Task

def assign_random_departments_to_schools(num_departments_to_assign=2):
    schools = School_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True)
    departments = Department_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True)

    for school in schools:
        selected_departments = random.sample(list(departments), k=min(num_departments_to_assign, len(departments)))
        school.department_ID.clear()
        for department in selected_departments:
            school.department_ID.add(department)
        print(f"Assigned departments to {school.school_name}: {[dept.department_name for dept in selected_departments]}")

def run():
    assign_random_departments_to_schools()
```
### 2. Teacher App Script (teacher_app/scripts.py)

* Update Teacher Schools: Updates teachers with random schools from active schools.
* Assign Departments to Teachers: Assigns departments to teachers based on their school.
```python
import random
from school_app.models import School_Task
from teacher_app.models import Teachers_Task

def update_teacher_schools():
    active_schools = School_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True)
    if not active_schools:
        print("No active schools found. Aborting update.")
        return

    for teacher in Teachers_Task.objects.all():
        random_school = random.choice(active_schools)
        teacher.school_ID = random_school
        teacher.save()
        print(f'Updated school_ID for {teacher.name} to {random_school.school_name}.')

def assign_departments_to_teachers():
    teachers = Teachers_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True)
    for teacher in teachers:
        school = teacher.school_ID
        if school:
            departments = school.department_ID.all()
            if departments.exists():
                selected_department = random.choice(departments)
                teacher.department_ID.add(selected_department)
                teacher.save()
                print(f'Assigned {selected_department.department_name} to {teacher.name}.')
```
### 3. Student App Script (student_app/scripts.py)
* Update Students Schools: Updates students with random schools from active schools.
* Assign Departments and Teachers to Students: Assigns departments and teachers to students based on their school.

```python

import random
from school_app.models import School_Task
from teacher_app.models import Teachers_Task
from student_app.models import Student_Task

def update_students_schools():
    active_schools = School_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True)
    if not active_schools:
        print("No active schools found. Aborting update.")
        return
    
    for student in Student_Task.objects.all():
        random_school = random.choice(active_schools)
        student.school_ID = random_school
        student.save()
        print(f"Updated student {student.name} with school {random_school.school_name}")
    
def assign_departments_to_students():
    students = Student_Task.objects.all()
    for student in students:
        school = student.school_ID
        if school:
            departments = school.department_ID.all()
            if departments.exists():
                selected_department = random.choice(departments)
                student.department_ID = selected_department
                student.save()
                print(f"Assigned department {selected_department.department_ID} to student {student.roll_no} in school {school.school_ID}")
                
def assign_teacher_to_students():
    students = Student_Task.objects.all()
    for student in students:
        department = student.department_ID
        school = student.school_ID
        if department and school:
            teachers = Teachers_Task.objects.filter(department_ID=department, school_ID=school)
            if teachers.exists():
                selected_teacher = teachers.first()
                student.teacher_id = selected_teacher
                student.save()
                print(f"Assigned teacher {selected_teacher.name} to student {student.name} in department {department.department_name}")
