# Updation on Student Task

## Model Updates

1. **Added Performance Field to Teacher_Task Model**  
   The `Teacher_Task` model was updated to include a new field for performance metrics:
   ```python
   class Teacher_Task(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       employee_id = models.IntegerField(default=0, primary_key=True)
       performance = models.FloatField(default=0.0)
   ```

2. **Calculate Performance Based on Student's Marks**  
   The performance of teachers will now be calculated based on the existing students' marks in their respective subjects.

## Shell Operations

The shell was used for a batch operation to associate students with their respective teachers:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

In the shell, the following code was executed to update each student's `teacher_id` based on the teacher's name:
```python
for student in students:
    teacher_name = student.class_teacher
    try:
        teacher = Teacher_Task.objects.get(name=teacher_name)
        student.teacher_id = teacher
        student.save()
        print(f"Updated {student.name} with teacher '{teacher.name}' (employee_id={teacher.employee_id})")
    except Teacher_Task.DoesNotExist:
        print(f"Teacher '{teacher_name}' not found in Teacher_Task for student {student.name}.")
```
This updated the teacher information for several students.

## Using Script File

A new script named `demo.py` was created inside the `scripts` folder to calculate and update teacher performance based on their students' average marks:
```python
from student_app.models import Student_Task, Teacher_Task
from utils.utils import calculate_average

def update_teacher_performance():
    max_score = 300  # Maximum score for the subjects
    teachers = Teacher_Task.objects.all()
    for teacher in teachers:
        students = Student_Task.objects.filter(teacher_id=teacher)
        average_performance = calculate_average(students)
        
        if average_performance == 0:
            performance_percentage = 0
        else:
            performance_percentage = (average_performance / max_score) * 100
        
        teacher.performance = performance_percentage
        teacher.save()
        
        print(f"Teacher {teacher.name}'s performance updated to {performance_percentage:.2f}%")

def run():
    update_teacher_performance()
```

The script can be executed using:
```bash
python manage.py runscript demo
```

### Foreign Key setup

After creating the performance field, a `teacher_id` was added to connect the `Student_Task` model with the `Teacher_Task` model through the `employee_id`. The updated models are as follows:

```python


class Student_Task(models.Model):
    
    teacher_id = models.ForeignKey('Teacher_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
    #others feilds here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


# Teacher model
class Teacher_Task(models.Model):
    
    employee_id = models.IntegerField(default=0, primary_key=True)
    #other feilds here
```
