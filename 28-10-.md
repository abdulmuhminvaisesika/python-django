# Student Task Project Updations




## 1. Active and Inactive Status Management

### Adding `is_active` Field to Models

The `is_active` field has been added to each model in the project to manage the active or inactive state of entities (students, teachers, departments, and schools). This field is a `BooleanField`, defaulting to `True`.

```python
is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

### API Views for Filtering Active and Inactive Status

API endpoints have been created to retrieve active or inactive records for each main entity. This includes endpoints for `School_Task`, `Teacher_Task`, `Student_Task`, and `Department_Task`.

#### Example: `SchoolStatusView`

The `SchoolStatusView` allows filtering schools by their active status using a parameterized URL. Based on the `status` parameter (`active` or `inactive`), the API returns the respective list of schools.

```python
class SchoolStatusView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, status):
        if status == 'active':
            schools = School_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True)
        elif status == 'inactive':
            schools = School_Task.objects.filter(is_active=False)
        else:
            return Response({"error": "Invalid status. Use 'active' or 'inactive'."}, status=400)

        serializer = SchoolTaskSerializer(schools, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```

## 2. Trigger Logic in `save` Methods for Dependent Models

Triggers have been set up in the `save` methods of the `School_Task` and `Teachers_Task` models to ensure consistency in related models. For instance, setting a school or teacher to inactive automatically updates associated teachers and students to inactive.

### Trigger in `School_Task` Model

When a school’s `is_active` status changes, the status of all teachers and students under that school is also updated to match.

```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    if self.pk is not None:
        old_instance = School_Task.objects.get(pk=self.pk)
        if old_instance.is_active != self.is_active:
            Teachers_Task = apps.get_model('teacher_app', 'Teachers_Task')
            Student_Task = apps.get_model('student_app', 'Student_Task')

            Teachers_Task.objects.filter(school_ID=self).update(is_active=self.is_active)
            Student_Task.objects.filter(teacher_id__school_ID=self).update(is_active=self.is_active)

    super(School_Task, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
```

### Trigger in `Teachers_Task` Model

If a teacher’s `is_active` status is modified, all students associated with that teacher will also have their status updated to match the teacher’s new status.

```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    if self.pk is not None:
        old_instance = Teachers_Task.objects.get(pk=self.pk)
        if old_instance.is_active != self.is_active:
            Student_Task = apps.get_model('student_app', 'Student_Task')
            Student_Task.objects.filter(teacher_id=self).update(is_active=self.is_active)

    super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

## 3. Active and Custom Managers

### Active Manager

An **Active Manager** is a custom manager that simplifies queries by only returning records where `is_active=True`. This manager is beneficial when there is a frequent need to retrieve only active records.

```python
from django.db import models

class ActiveManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_active=True)
```

### Custom Manager

Custom managers allow the creation of specific query sets tailored to meet various requirements. For example, methods for retrieving only inactive objects or counting active records can be added.

```python
class CustomManager(models.Manager):
    def inactive(self):
        # Returns only inactive objects
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_active=False)

    def active_count(self):
        # Returns the count of active objects
        return self.get_queryset().filter(is_active=True).count()
```

### Usage of `get_queryset().count()`

The `get_queryset().count()` method is used to count records within a manager’s query set, such as finding the count of active or inactive records. This method is efficient for retrieving counts based on specific conditions.

#### Example: Counting Active Students

```python
active_students_count = Student_Task.objects.filter(is_active=True).count()
```
