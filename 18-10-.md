## Serializers

The `StudentTaskSerializer` is used to serialize the `Student_Task` model data:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Student_Task

class StudentTaskSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    total_marks = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
    percentage = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    class Meta:
        model = Student_Task
        fields = ['name', 'roll_no', 'chemistry', 'physics', 'maths', 'class_teacher', 'total_marks', 'percentage']

    def get_total_marks(self, obj):
        return obj.total_marks()

    def get_percentage(self, obj):
        return obj.percentage()

```
## Admin Registration
The Student_Task model is registered in the Django admin panel to allow easy management of student records:


``` python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Student_Task

admin.site.register(Student_Task)
```
