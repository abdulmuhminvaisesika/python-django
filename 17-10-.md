## Django Project for CRUD Operations Using Simple API and Postman



Django project for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Django REST Framework and Postman for testing.



### Django REST Framework (DRF)

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. It simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs by providing a range of features, such as authentication, serialization, and class-based views, all while adhering to Django’s principles.

*Key Features:*
* Serialization: Easily convert complex data (e.g., Django models) into JSON, XML, or other content types for API responses.

* Authentication & Permissions: Built-in authentication mechanisms like token-based authentication, session authentication, and more.

* Browsable API: DRF provides a web-browsable API interface to interact with your APIs, which is useful during development.

### Serializers

In Django REST Framework, serializers are used to convert data between Django model instances (or other complex types) and native Python data types (like dictionaries), which can then be rendered into JSON or XML for APIs.


*Serializer Usage:*
1. Serialization: Convert Django model instances or querysets into JSON so they can be sent as an API response.

2. Deserialization: Parse incoming JSON or XML data and convert it back into Python objects or model instances.

3. Validation: Serializers validate incoming data before saving it to the database, ensuring the integrity of the API data.

*Example of a Serializer:*
``` python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Student

class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Student
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'roll_no']
```
### URL Patterns in Django REST Framework

In DRF, URL patterns define the endpoints of your API. They map URL paths to specific views or viewsets, which handle the logic for CRUD operations.


*Defining URLs:*
In the urls.py file of your Django app, you define the paths for the API endpoints. These paths are linked to view classes that handle the requests.


*Example URL patterns for CRUD operations:*
``` python
from django.urls import path
from .views import StudentListCreate, StudentRetrieveUpdateDestroy

urlpatterns = [
    path('students/', StudentListCreate.as_view(), name='student-list-create'),  # GET all, POST
    path('students/<int:pk>/', StudentRetrieveUpdateDestroy.as_view(), name='student-detail'),  # GET by ID, PUT, DELETE
]
```
### Project: Django CRUD API for Students

*Project Overview:*

This project implements an API to manage a list of students, with the following CRUD operations:

* Get all students
* Get a student by ID
* Add a new student
* Update a student by ID
* Delete a student by ID
  
**Model: Student**

The Student model represents the data structure for storing student information.
``` python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    roll_no = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
**Views.py**

The views handle the CRUD logic for the student data. You’ve used Django REST Framework’s generic views to make it simpler.
1. Get All Students

    This operation is handled by the get() method in the StudentView class.
    ``` python
    class StudentView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        students = Student.objects.all()
        serializer = Studentserializers(students, many=True)  
        return Response(serializer.data) 
    ```
2. Get a Student by ID
   
    This is handled by the get() method in the StudentDetailView class.


    ``` python
    class StudentDetailView(APIView):
    def get(self, request, id):
        students = Student.objects.get(id=id)  
        serializer = Studentserializers(students) 
        return Response(serializer.data)  
3. Add a New Student

   This operation is handled by the post() method in the StudentView class.
   ``` python
   class StudentView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        serialize = Studentserializers(data=request.data)  
        if serialize.is_valid():
            serialize.save() 
            return Response(serialize.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)  
        else:
            return Response(serialize.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)  
    ```
4. Update a Student by ID

    This operation is handled by the put() method in the StudentDetailView class.
    ``` python 
    class StudentDetailView(APIView):
    def put(self, request, id):
        students = Student.objects.get(id=id) 
        serialize = Studentserializers(students, data=request.data) 
        if serialize.is_valid():
            serialize.save()  
            return Response(serialize.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)  
        else:
            return Response(serialize.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)  
    ```
5. Delete a Student by ID

    This operation is handled by the delete() method in the StudentDetailView class.

    ``` python
    class StudentDetailView(APIView):
    def delete(self, request, id):
        try:
            students = Student.objects.get(id=id)  
            name = students.Name  
            students.delete()  
            return Response({'message': f'Student {name} deleted successfully'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)  
        except Student.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'error': 'Student not found'}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)  
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
            return Response({'error': 'An error occurred'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)  
    ```
