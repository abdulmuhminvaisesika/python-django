# Updation on Student Task





## Code Optimization

1. **Optimizing Models, Views, and Serializers**:
   - Repetitive logic across models, views, and serializers was identified and removed.
   - Common logic, such as calculations and helper functions, was centralized in a new `utils.py` file.

2. **Creating `utils.py`**:
   - A new file named `utils.py` was created to store reusable logic.
   - Methods to calculate total marks and percentage were defined:

   ```python
   # utils.py
   def calculate_total_marks(chemistry, physics, maths):
       """Calculate the total marks for a student."""
       return chemistry + physics + maths

   def calculate_percentage(total_marks):
       """Calculate the percentage based on total marks."""
       return (total_marks / 300) * 100
   ```

3. **Student_Task Model**:
   - The `Student_Task` model was updated to include fields for student information and marks, along with logic for calculating total marks and percentage:

   ```python
   class Student_Task(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       roll_no = models.IntegerField(default=1, primary_key=True)
       chemistry = models.IntegerField(default=0)
       physics = models.IntegerField(default=0)
       maths = models.IntegerField(default=0)
       
       total_marks_field = models.IntegerField(default=0)  
       percentage_field = models.FloatField(default=0.0)   

       def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
           self.total_marks_field = calculate_total_marks(self.chemistry, self.physics, self.maths)
           self.percentage_field = calculate_percentage(self.total_marks_field)
           super(Student_Task, self).save(*args, **kwargs)

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name
   ```

   - **Fields**:
     - `name`: CharField for the student's name.
     - `roll_no`: IntegerField as the primary key.
     - `chemistry`, `physics`, `maths`: IntegerFields for subject marks.
     - `total_marks_field`: IntegerField for calculated total marks.
     - `percentage_field`: FloatField for calculated percentage.

   - The `save` method calculates total marks and percentage before saving the instance, ensuring these fields are updated.

## New Teacher_Task Model

1. **Creating the Teacher_Task Model**:
   - A new model, `Teacher_Task`, was developed to manage teacher records:

   ```python
   class Teacher_Task(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       employee_id = models.IntegerField(default=0, primary_key=True)
   ```

   - **Fields**:
     - `name`: CharField for the teacher's name.
     - `employee_id`: IntegerField as the primary key for teachers.

2. **Creating the TeacherTaskSerializer**:
   - A serializer for the `Teacher_Task` model was implemented:

   ```python
   class TeacherTaskSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = Teacher_Task
           fields = ['name', 'employee_id']   
   ```

## Introduction to Celery and Redis

- **Celery** and **Redis** were introduced as tools for task management.
- **Celery** facilitates the execution of background tasks.
- **Redis** serves as a message broker for Celery, enabling task queuing and asynchronous processing.
- **Celery-Beat** was mentioned as a scheduler for periodic tasks, allowing for future task execution and automation features.
