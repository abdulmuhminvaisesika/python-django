# Student Task Updation

## 1. Updated `Student_Task` Model

### **Removed Subject Fields in `Student_Task` Model**
- Removed the fields related to subjects (`maths`, `chemistry`, and `physics`) from the `Student_Task` model, as they are no longer needed.

### **Manual Total Marks Assignment**
- Replaced the subject fields with a new field for manually assigning the total marks to each student.
- This change allows the `total_marks_field` to be populated manually, instead of being automatically calculated from the individual subject marks.

```python
class Student_Task(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    roll_no = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    
    
    total_marks_field = models.IntegerField(default=0)  
    percentage_field = models.FloatField(default=0.0)   
    teacher_id = models.ForeignKey('teacher_app.Teachers_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
    department_ID = models.ForeignKey('department_app.Department_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
    school_ID = models.ForeignKey('school_app.School_Task', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True, related_name="students")

    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

```

## 2. Settings Update in settings.py
### Disabled Debug Mode and Allowed Hosts
* Updated settings.py to disable DEBUG mode for production readiness and configured ALLOWED_HOSTS to accept requests from any host.
```python
# Updated settings.py
DEBUG = False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']  # Allows all hosts for now, adjust as needed for security
```

## 3. Database Tools and Setup
### Downloaded and Set Up DBeaver
* Installed DBeaver to manage the project's database and facilitate easy viewing and manipulation of database tables and data.
* Configured DBeaver to connect to the Django project's database, providing a graphical interface for database management.
